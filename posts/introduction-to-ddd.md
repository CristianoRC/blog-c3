# Introduction to Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on creating a shared understanding between developers and domain experts. It provides a set of patterns and practices that help teams tackle complex domains effectively.

## Core Concepts

### Ubiquitous Language

One of the fundamental principles of DDD is establishing a ubiquitous language - a common vocabulary shared between developers and domain experts. This language should:

- Be used consistently in code, documentation, and conversations
- Reflect the domain model accurately
- Evolve as understanding of the domain deepens

### Bounded Contexts

A bounded context is a clear boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. It helps in:

- Managing complexity by dividing large systems
- Maintaining model consistency within boundaries
- Defining clear integration points between different parts of the system

### Aggregates

Aggregates are clusters of domain objects that are treated as a single unit. They help in:

- Maintaining data consistency
- Enforcing business rules
- Defining transaction boundaries

## Strategic Design

Strategic DDD helps in understanding the big picture:

- Context Mapping: Understanding relationships between different bounded contexts
- Core Domain: Identifying what's most important to the business
- Supporting Domains: Recognizing auxiliary functionalities

## Getting Started

To start applying DDD in your projects:

1. Focus on the domain, not the technology
2. Collaborate closely with domain experts
3. Model around business complexity, not data
4. Use bounded contexts to manage model boundaries
5. Implement tactical patterns where they make sense
